## **🔍Overview**

  

Welcome to **🤖Agents**, an easy-to-use toolkit for building customized AI agents.
With our Agent module, all you need to do is generate and modify particular prompts with the help of **🧩Component** module . Sequently, as aforementioned, those stylized prompts, graved in **✨States**, will define your agent's status, styles, etc. Numerous sorts of States altogether formed our **📋Standard Operation Process(SOP) System**, which helps run your agents under sophisticated circumstances.

  

## **🚀Highlights**
  

- SOP system is a reasoning graph which contains several SOPs, often designed for diverse agents. By following the SOP System, every individual agent's workflow and task is built. Undoubtly, each single agent can be easily controlled and generated by its own SOP.

  

- Our SOP System has the ability to support for both `multi-agent` and `single-agent` modes of operation. Users can choose to engage with a single robot for simulating scenario-based conversations, or they can utilize multiple robots to engage in mutual dialogues, enabling the system to self-monitor and evolve iteratively.

  

- 🤖 `Single-Agent Mode`: Under this circumstance, users engage with one particular agent. For example, you can use our **oculist agent** for medical assistance. The oculist agents serves as an expertised medical assistant which provides instructions and advice for ophthalmic diseases, and guides patients to pre-fill information cards and make advance appointments for clinic slots.

- 🤖🤖 `Multi-Agent Mode`: The multi-agent mode is a major highlight of ours. In this mode, users can summon multiple robots for collaborative or reciprocal conversations, facilitating comprehensive debugging of the SOP system and performance testing of individual robots. For instance, when a user sets up a new Agent, they can engage in dialogue with a Chatting Agent to test the logic and style of the newly created Agent.Click here for detailed information.
