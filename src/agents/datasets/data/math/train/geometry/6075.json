    "problem": "Consider the set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular parallelepiped (box) that measures $3$ by $4$ by $5$ units. Given that the volume of this set is $\\frac{m + n\\pi}{p},$ where $m, n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, and $n$ and $p$ are relatively prime, find $m + n + p.$\n",

Together, their volume is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.\nThere are $12$ of the $1/4$ cylinders, so $3$ complete cylinders can be formed. Their volumes are $3\\pi$, $4\\pi$, and $5\\pi$, adding up to $12\\pi$.\nThe combined volume of these parts is $60+94+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi+12\\pi = \\frac{462+40\\pi}{3}$. Thus, the answer is $m+n+p = 462+40+3 = \\boxed{505}$."
