Each node corresponds to tasks that need to be completed, and you can find the task descriptions in the node_description.\n\nAn SOP mainly consists of Nodes, each responsible for completing certain tasks to achieve the overall task. Each Node has a name, description, successor nodes, and a controller. Successor nodes are a dictionary (edges), with keys being the names of the successor nodes and values being the Node objects of the successors. The controller is a dictionary containing control information for this Node, including transit type (transit_type) and transit conditions (transit_system_prompt and transit_last_prompt). There are two types of transit: llm and order. Order means sequential transit, transferring to the first non-self node in the current node's corresponding dictionary in edges. LLM means transferring according to the output of the language model, requiring transit_system_prompt and transit_last_prompt.\n\nHere is an example of an SOP:\n```json\n{\n    \"nodes\": {\n        \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"Debate_Order_node\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"Debate_Random_node\": {\n            \"node_name\": \"Debate_Random_node\",\n            \"controller\": {\n                \"transit_type\": \"order\",\n                \"transit_system_prompt\": \"\",\n                \"transit_last_prompt\": \"\",\n            },\n            \"node_description\": \"We are now in the open debate phase, where each debater has the freedom to speak as they wish.\\nThe debate topic is as follows: <debate topic>\\n<Theme>should Hermione Granger develop a romantic relationship with Harry Potter or Ron Weasley?</Theme>\\n <Affirmative viewpoint> Supporting Hermione and Harry together.</Affirmative viewpoint>\\n<Negative viewpoint> Supporting Hermione and Ron together</Negative viewpoint>\\n</debate topic>\\n \",\n        },\n        \"Judge_node\": {\n            ...\n        }\n    },\n    \"edges\": {\n        \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\": [\n            \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\",\n            \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\": [\n            \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\",\n            \"Debate_Order_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Debate_Order_node\": [\n            \"Debate_Order_node\",\n            \"Debate_Random_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Debate_Random_node\": [\n            \"Debate_Random_node\",\n            \"Judge_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Judge_node\": [\n            \"Judge_node\",\n            \"end_node\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"root\": \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\",\n    \"end\": \"end_node\"\n}\n```\n\nYou need to provide optimization suggestions in natural language. Generally, optimizing this SOP can involve five aspects, and you can combine multiple suggestions:\n\n1. Add nodes: If you think some nodes are missing from the SOP, you can add these nodes. You need to describe the information of these nodes, including the node name, description, successor nodes, and controller configuration.\n2. Delete nodes: If you think some nodes in the SOP are redundant, you can delete these nodes. You need to specify the names of the nodes to be deleted and update the predecessor nodes' successor nodes to replace the deleted nodes.\n3. Update node descriptions: If you think the descriptions of the nodes in the SOP are not clear enough, you can update these descriptions. You need to provide the node names and the new descriptions.\n4. Update the relationships between nodes: If you think the relationships between the nodes in the SOP are not clear enough, you can update these relationships. You need to specify the relationships to be updated between the nodes.\n5. Update the transit conditions between nodes: If you think the transit conditions between the nodes in the SOP are not clear enough, you can update these transit conditions. You need to specify the transit conditions to be updated between the nodes.\n\nI will provide you with a specific SOP configuration and a run instance. You need to analyze the run instance and provide optimization suggestions. The analysis should be enclosed in <analyse></analyse>, and the suggestions should be enclosed in <suggestion></suggestion>. For example:\n<analyse>The actual performance of Debate_Random_node is not good, you can try adding a node before it.</analyse>\n<suggestion>Add a node before Debate_Random_node, named Added_Debate_Random_node, with the description: \"Further debate to clarify the arguments,\" its successor nodes being itself and Debate_Random_node, with the controller transit type as \"order\".</suggestion>\n\n",

I will give you a standard operation procedure (SOP) for handling a task, which contains multiple Nodes. Each Node is responsible for completing certain tasks to achieve the overall task.\n\nI will provide you with an SOP and a run instance, and you need to analyze this SOP and provide your optimization suggestions. Each node corresponds to tasks that need to be completed, and you can find the task descriptions in the node_description.\n\nAn SOP mainly consists of Nodes, each responsible for completing certain tasks to achieve the overall task. Each Node has a name, description, successor nodes, and a controller. Successor nodes are a dictionary (edges), with keys being the names of the successor nodes and values being the Node objects of the successors. The controller is a dictionary containing control information for this Node, including transit type (transit_type) and transit conditions (transit_system_prompt and transit_last_prompt). There are two types of transit: llm and order. Order means sequential transit, transferring to the first non-self node in the current node's corresponding dictionary in edges. LLM means transferring according to the output of the language model, requiring transit_system_prompt and transit_last_prompt.\n\nHere is an example of an SOP:\n```json\n{\n    \"nodes\": {\n        \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"Debate_Order_node\": {\n            ...\n        },\n        \"Debate_Random_node\": {\n            \"node_name\": \"Debate_Random_node\",\n            \"controller\": {\n                \"transit_type\": \"order\",\n                \"transit_system_prompt\": \"\",\n                \"transit_last_prompt\": \"\",\n            },\n            \"node_description\": \"We are now in the open debate phase, where each debater has the freedom to speak as they wish.\\nThe debate topic is as follows: <debate topic>\\n<Theme>should Hermione Granger develop a romantic relationship with Harry Potter or Ron Weasley?</Theme>\\n <Affirmative viewpoint> Supporting Hermione and Harry together.</Affirmative viewpoint>\\n<Negative viewpoint> Supporting Hermione and Ron together</Negative viewpoint>\\n</debate topic>\\n \",\n        },\n        \"Judge_node\": {\n            ...\n        }\n    },\n    \"edges\": {\n        \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\": [\n            \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\",\n            \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\": [\n            \"Negative_Task_Allocation_node\",\n            \"Debate_Order_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Debate_Order_node\": [\n            \"Debate_Order_node\",\n            \"Debate_Random_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Debate_Random_node\": [\n            \"Debate_Random_node\",\n            \"Judge_node\"\n        ],\n        \"Judge_node\": [\n            \"Judge_node\",\n            \"end_node\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"root\": \"Affirmative_Task_Allocation_node\",\n    \"end\": \"end_node\"\n}\n```\n\nI will provide you with an SOP and suggestions for modifications to this SOP.
